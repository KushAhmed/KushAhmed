I enjoy creating software solutions and web presence. My interest in coding started back in the college days when I studied BTEC Computing course. Although, I ventured in different fields, I now decided to study and enhance on the skills learned in software development.

In my computer course, I have learned to program in COBOL and C/C++, relational databases and software development life cycle. Using the skills learned, developed a software solutions to a real-life scenario based project and involved in all stages of software development life cycle.

Currently, I'm focused on learning full-stack software development and enrolled on the Skills Bootcamp in Web Design & Development at The Coder Guilds. I'm hoping to gain valuable skills in coding to land a trainee/junior software developer role.
